/// Functions
// A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It helps in
// organizing code and avoiding repetition.

// 4. In dart, functions are first-class objects, it can be assign to variable, pass
//    as a parameter to another function ans can be used as returned from others functions.

/// Advantages
// Reduce code duplication.
// Improves code readability.
// Makes complex programs easier to understand.
// Helps in maintaining and testing code.

/// Difference Between Function and Method
// Function: Defined outside a class and Independent block of code.
// Method: A function defined inside a class and Works on the data (properties) of that class.

/// Syntax
