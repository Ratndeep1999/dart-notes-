/// Functions
// It is a block of the code to perform that use to perform specific task.

/// DRY
// Don't repeat yourself (main objective of any function)

/// Key Points
// 1. Use to divide large part of code into small part.
// 2. Use to perform repetitive operation in small part of code
//    like re-usability of repetitive component.
// 3. It gives readability, and helps to make program simple and maintainable.
// 4. In dart, function is an object, it can be assign to variable, pass
//    as a parameter to another function ans can be used as returned value as well.

/// Advantages
// Helps to reduce code and give readability.
// Helps to avoid code repetition.
// Helps to divide complex program into small part for readability.

/// Difference between Function and Method
// Method():
// When a function written inside class, where function is just an individual entity.

// Function():
// It is a block of code that perform a specific task, basically function
// created outside any class.
